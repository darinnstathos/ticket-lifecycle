1. Navigate to the end-user URL: http://localhost/osTicket/
2. Select “Open a Ticket”
3. Write in the fields provided: (for practice sake)

- Email: karen@osticket.com
- Name: Karen Karen
- Help Topic [we created these earlier]: Business Critical Outage

- Extra Information: “Customers are reporting that they're getting a 404 error when browsing to online banking”

4. Select "Create Ticket"
